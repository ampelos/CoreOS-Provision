# CoreOS-Provision
An automatic provisioning script for creating a CoreOS cluster through CLI.

###### Why was this created?
I needed a vacation so I took a week off and went to Los Angeles to hang out with my friends. I quickly found out how hard it was to seriously take a vacation from coding. During luls and early mornings when everyone else was waking up I created this: a portable bash script that I can take to whatever Azure infrastructure my employer can afford me.

##### CoreOS?
This is a top of the line, cutting edge server operating system. If your interested in having a distributed cluster management system. CoreOS clustered with Fleet means you can sustain a VPS failure, DDOS attack, and keep your applications containerized and backed up within a Docker registry that will sit in the Azure storage environment generated in this script.

This repository is Felix's bag of tricks.
